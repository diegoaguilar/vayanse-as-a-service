# Vayanse As a Service [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diegoaguilar/vayanse-as-a-service.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/diegoaguilar/vayanse-as-a-service)


## Motivation

Ever been to a Slack team where #random channel is not enough for off topics, nonsenses and struggles? Probably you may desire a way to quickly send a member talking out of the blue to a proper #channel?

What if you could just do `/vayanse a #la-terminal` via an slack command?

## Features

* Invite or mention slack team members to channels.
* Create slack channels on the go.
* Put custom messages on the go via command arguments.

## Test

Simply run `npm test`

# Usage

`/vayanse a <#chanel-name> <@username1 @username2>`
