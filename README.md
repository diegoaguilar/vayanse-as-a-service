# Vayanse As a Service

## Motivation

Ever been to a Slack team where #random channel is not enough for off topics, nonsenses and struggles? Probably you may desire a way to quickly send a member talking out of the blue to a proper #channel?

What if you could just do `/vayanse a #la-terminal` via an slack command?

## Test

Simply run `npm test`

# Usage

## Deploy
